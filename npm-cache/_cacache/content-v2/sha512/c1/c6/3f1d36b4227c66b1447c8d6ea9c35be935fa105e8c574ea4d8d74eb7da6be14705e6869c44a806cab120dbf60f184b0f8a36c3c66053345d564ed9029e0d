react-native-qrcode-scanner\n\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-qrcode-scanner.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-qrcode-scanner) [![Backers on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/react-native-qrcode-scanner/backers/badge.svg)](#backers) [![Sponsors on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/react-native-qrcode-scanner/sponsors/badge.svg)](#sponsors)\n\nA QR code scanner component for React Native built on top of [react-native-camera by Lochlan Wansbrough](https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera)\n\nPlease note, this will also function as a generic barcode scanner by the virtue of the above module supporting barcode scanning, however, this module was initially built as a QR code scanner.\n\nThis module was originally written because the author couldn't find a module that could be simply plugged into a project without requiring too much setup.\n\nLooking for active contributors. See [Contribution guide](https://github.com/moaazsidat/react-native-qrcode-scanner/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION.md) for more details.\n\n_**Please note**: Most of the support on debugging new issues, especially with Android, relies on the open source community. The project is on the look out for active contributors who want to maintain this library more rigorously._\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Requirements\n\n#### iOS 10\n\nWith iOS 10 and higher you need to add the \"Privacy - Camera Usage Description\" key to the info.plist of your project. This should be found in 'your_project/ios/your_project/Info.plist'. Add the following code:\n\n```\n<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Your message to user when the camera is accessed for the first time</string>\n\n<!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the camera roll -->\n<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Your message to user when the photo library is accessed for the first time</string>\n\n<!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the microphone for video recording -->\n<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Your message to user when the microsphone is accessed for the first time</string>\n```\n\n#### Android 7\n\nWith Android 7 and higher you need to add the \"Vibration\" permission to your AndroidManifest.xml of your project. This should be found in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` Add the following:\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.VIBRATE\"/>\n```\nYou need to add the \"missingDimensionStrategy\" config for the 'react-native-camera' setting  to 'general', this should be found in your `android/app/build.gradle` add the following:\n```\nandroid {\n  ...\n  defaultConfig {\n    ...\n    missingDimensionStrategy 'react-native-camera', 'general' <-- insert this line\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### react-native-camera\n\n[react-native-camera](https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera) is a dependency for this package that you'll need to add to your project. To install, run the following commands:\n\n1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`\n2. `react-native link react-native-camera`\n\n#### New Version/Migration\n\nIf using an older version of this module with RCTCamera you will need to follow the docs [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera/blob/master/docs/migration.md) to move from the old RCTCamera to the new RNCamera. You will then need to install it as above.\n\n**Versions of this library > 0.0.30 will not support react-native-camera versions less than 1.0.0.**\n\n### To install and start using react-native-qrcode-scanner:\n\n1. `npm install react-native-qrcode-scanner --save`\n2. `react-native link react-native-qrcode-scanner`\n\n#### react-native-permissions\n\nYou will also need to install react-native-permissions to handle camera related permissions\n\n1. `npm install react-native-permissions --save`\n2. `react-native link react-native-permissions`\n\nFor iOS, as part of the [react-native-permissions setup](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-permissions#setup) you will need to add the following code to your `Podfile`\n\n```\npermissions_path = '../node_modules/react-native-permissions/ios'\npod 'Permission-Camera', :path => \"#{permissions_path}/Camera\"\n```\n\nYou may also need to reset your simulator data after adding those permissions `Device -> Erase All Content and Settings...`\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use react-native-qrcode-scanner, `import` the `react-native-qrcode-scanner` module and use the `<QRCodeScanner />` tag. More usage examples can be seen under the `examples/` folder.\n\nHere is an example of basic usage:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nimport {\n  AppRegistry,\n  StyleSheet,\n  Text,\n  TouchableOpacity,\n  Linking\n} from 'react-native';\n\nimport QRCodeScanner from 'react-native-qrcode-scanner';\nimport { RNCamera } from 'react-native-camera';\n\nclass ScanScreen extends Component {\n  onSuccess = e => {\n    Linking.openURL(e.data).catch(err =>\n      console.error('An error occured', err)\n    );\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <QRCodeScanner\n        onRead={this.onSuccess}\n        flashMode={RNCamera.Constants.FlashMode.torch}\n        topContent={\n          <Text style={styles.centerText}>\n            Go to{' '}\n            <Text style={styles.textBold}>wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code</Text> on\n            your computer and scan the QR code.\n          </Text>\n        }\n        bottomContent={\n          <TouchableOpacity style={styles.buttonTouchable}>\n            <Text style={styles.buttonText}>OK.

Use this by attaching a `ref` like so `<QRCodeScanner ref={(node) => { this.scanner = node }}>` and calling `this.scanner.reactivate()`\n\n## Props\n\n#### `onRead` (required)\n\npropType: `func.isRequired`\ndefault: `(e) => (console.log('QR code scanned!', e))`\n\nWill call this specified method when a QR code or a barcode is detected in the camera's view passing in the event emitted upon reading the code.\n\n#### `fadeIn`\n\npropType: `bool`\ndefault: `true`\n\nWhen set to `true` this ensures that the camera view fades in after the initial load up instead of being rendered immediately.\nSet this to false to prevent the animated fade in of the camera view.\n\n#### `reactivate`\n\npropType: `bool`\ndefault: `false`\n\nWhen set to `false`, when a QR code is scanned, the `QRCodeScanner` will not scan another code until it is re-rendered.\nWhen set to `true` this will reactivate the scanning ability of the component.\n\n#### `reactivateTimeout`\n\npropType: `number`\ndefault: `0`\n\nUse this to configure how long it should take (in milliseconds) before the `QRCodeScanner` should reactivate.\n\n\n#### `cameraTimeout`\npropType: `number`\ndefault: `0`\n\nUse this to configure how long it should take (in milliseconds) before the `QRCodeScanner` should be displayed. After that the camera will be inactive and press the view to reactivate it.\nThe `0` default means it's always on.\n\n#### `cameraTimeoutView`\n\npropType: `element`\n\nPass an RN element/component to show it when the camera is inactive for `cameraTimeout` (another prop) milliseconds. If the `cameraTimeout` is 0 or not specified, this prop will never be used.\n\n#### `flashMode`\n\npropType: `RNCamera.Constants.FlashMode`\ndefault: `RNCamera.Constants.FlashMode.auto`\n\n**Flash modes**\n\nFYI: [react-native-camera/flashMode](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera/blob/master/docs/RNCamera.md#flashmode)\n\n- `RNCamera.Constants.FlashMode.off` turns it off.\n- `RNCamera.Constants.FlashMode.on` means camera will use flash in all photos taken.\n- `RNCamera.Constants.FlashMode.auto` leaves your phone to decide when to use flash when taking photos, based on the lightning conditions that the camera observes.\n- `RNCamera.Constants.FlashMode.torch` turns on torch mode, meaning the flash light will be turned on all the time (even before taking photo) just like a flashlight.\n\n\n#### `topContent`\n\npropType: `oneOfType([ PropTypes.element, PropTypes.string, ])`\n\nUse this to render any additional content at the top of the camera view.\n\n#### `bottomContent`\n\npropType: `oneOfType([ PropTypes.element, PropTypes.string, ])`\n\nUse this to render any additional content at the bottom of the camera view.\n\n#### `containerStyle`\n\npropType: `any`\n\nUse this to pass styling for the outermost container. Useful for adding margin/padding to account for navigation bar.\n\n#### `cameraStyle`\n\npropType: `any`\n\nUse this to pass or overwrite styling for the camera window rendered.\n\n#### `cameraContainerStyle`\n\npropType: `any`\n\nUse this to pass or overwrite styling for the camera container (view) window rendered.\n\n#### `topViewStyle`\n\npropType: `any`\n\nUse this to pass or overwrite styling for the `<View>` that contains the `topContent` prop.\n\n#### `bottomViewStyle`\n\npropType: `any`\n\nUse this to pass or overwrite styling for the `<View>` that contains the `bottomContent` prop.\n\n#### `showMarker`\n\npropType: `boolean`\ndefault: `false`\n\nUse this to show marker on the camera scanning window.\n\n#### `customMarker`\n\npropType: `element`\n\nPass a RN element/component to use it as a custom marker.\n\n#### `markerStyle`\n\npropType: `any`\n\nUse this to add custom styling to the default marker.\n\n#### `notAuthorizedView`\n\npropType: `element`\n\nPass a RN element/component to use it when no permissions given to the camera (iOS only).\n\n#### `cameraType`\n\npropType: `oneOf(['front', 'back'])`\ndefault: `'back'`\n\nUse this to control which camera to use for scanning QR codes, defaults to rear camera.\n\n#### `checkAndroid6Permissions`\n\npropType: `bool`\ndefault: `false`\n\nUse this to enable permission checking on Android 6\n\n#### `permissionDialogTitle`\n\npropType: `string`\ndefault: `'Info'`\n\nUse this to set permission dialog title (Android only).\n\n#### `permissionDialogMessage`\n\npropType: `string`\ndefault: `'Need camera permission'`\n\nUse this to set permission dialog message (Android only).\n\n#### `buttonPositive`\n\npropType: `string`\ndefault: `'OK'`\n\nUse this to set permission dialog button text (Android only).\n\n#### `cameraProps`\n\npropType: `object`\n\nProperties to be passed to the `Camera` component.\n\n<!--## Contriubting-->\n<!--See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)-->\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
